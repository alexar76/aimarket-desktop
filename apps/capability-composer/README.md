**Desktop pipeline builder for the AI Market Protocol — Zapier for aimarket.**

Capability Composer is a Flutter desktop app (macOS / Windows / Linux) that lets you visually discover, chain, and sell AI capabilities from the [AI Market Protocol](https://github.com/alexar76/aimarket) marketplace. It is the Tier 4 meta-product that makes the economy itself more usable.

## Why Capability Composer?

The AI Market Protocol has thousands of individual capabilities — ATS scorers, cold email generators, CRM loggers, security scanners, trend detectors, and more. Each is powerful alone, but **pipelines** are where the real value lives.

Capability Composer lets you:

- **Buy** individual capabilities from the marketplace
- **Chain** them visually with a drag-and-drop node graph editor
- **Sell** the resulting pipelines as packaged products on the marketplace
- **Run** pipelines on a schedule, via webhook, or on-demand

This is a **meta-product**: it doesn't compete with capability sellers. It grows their market by making their offerings composable and discoverable through successful pipeline templates.

## User Stories

| Role | Pipeline | Benefit |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Recruiter** | LinkedIn analysis -> cold email -> CRM logging | 10x candidate outreach throughput |
| **Developer** | Code review -> security scan -> deploy check | Automated CI/CD quality gate |
| **Marketer** | Trend detection -> content generation -> scheduling | Always-on content pipeline |

See [docs/user-cases.md](docs/user-cases.md) for full walkthroughs.

## SDK Integration

Capability Composer is built on the [`aimarket_agent`](https://github.com/alexar76/aimarket-sdks/tree/main/dart) Dart SDK. See [docs/sdk-integration.md](docs/sdk-integration.md) for multi-capability orchestration examples.

```dart
final agent = AimarketAgent(hubUrl: 'https://hub.aicom.io', walletKey: key);

// Discover pipeline components
final linkedin = await agent.discover(intent: 'LinkedIn profile analysis', category: 'career');
final email = await agent.discover(intent: 'cold email generation', category: 'career');
final crm = await agent.discover(intent: 'CRM contact creation', category: 'productivity');

// Chain: linkedin.output -> email.input, email.output -> crm.input
```

---

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze
flutter analyze

# Build for production
flutter build macos --release
flutter build linux --release
flutter build windows --release
```
