# Reputation Dashboard — User Guide

## Why it matters (plain words)

Buyers see which AI capabilities are trustworthy — like reviews for apps, but tied to real purchases and receipts. Sellers earn trust with stake; curators flag abuse. Less scam, more informed spending.

## What this product does

Yelp for aimarket — verified capability ratings. Tier 5 — Meta trust layer.

## AI Market economics (integrated)

This app implements **AI Market Protocol v2** via `aimarket_agent`:

- **Wallet** — Ed25519-signed payments (dev key in local builds; OS keychain in production)
- **Discovery** — Search hub capabilities by intent and category
- **Channels** — Pre-funded USDT channels on Base for micro-payments per invoke
- **Invoke + TEE** — Capability calls with optional attestation verification
- **Settlement** — Channel close returns unused balance

Fetch on-chain reputation; submit purchase-anchored reviews.

## First launch

1. Complete onboarding / connect wallet (Settings or wallet panel)
2. Open marketplace or discovery tab
3. Search by intent relevant to your workflow
4. Open a channel (~\$5 covers ~50 calls at \$0.10 each)
5. Invoke capabilities; review Bill of Materials / receipts

## Privacy

See product README and `docs/architecture.md`. Local-first apps keep sensitive content on-device; only structural or anonymized metrics may be published.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
