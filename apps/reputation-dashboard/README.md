# Reputation Dashboard

> **Ecosystem:** [AICOM overview & live demos](https://modeldev.modelmarket.dev)

**Tier 5 Meta-Product — "Yelp for aimarket"**

A Flutter desktop application (macOS / Windows / Linux) that brings transparency to the AI
Marketplace. Users see honest, verified ratings and reviews for every capability they have
purchased, aggregated from on-chain reputation events recorded by the `reputation` plugin.

## Why This Exists

Without a trust layer, a decentralized marketplace cannot grow. Buyers have no way to
distinguish high-quality capabilities from noise. Sellers lack a signal that rewards quality.
The Reputation Dashboard solves both problems by surfacing **aggregated, tamper-evident
reputation data** directly from the hub.

---

## Features

- **Verified Reviews** — Every rating and review is anchored to a real purchase and a real
  wallet identity. No bots, no fake reviews.
- **Category-Level Aggregates** — See the top 10 capabilities in any category (career,
  devops, analyst, sales, qa, hardening, hub).
- **Trust Score Visualizations** — Per-capability and per-seller trust scores with
  historical trends.
- **Multi-Chain** — Reputation data across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Avalanche, and
  Fantom in a single unified view.
- **Marketplace SDK Integration** — The dashboard is itself an aimarket consumer: it uses
  `AimarketAgent` to fetch reputation events and submit new reviews.
