## What It Does

Interview Prep Coach is a Tier 1 product that transforms interview preparation from static, stale content to a dynamic marketplace where:

- **Buy side**: Discover and purchase interview question banks tagged by company (e.g., `company:google`, `role:swe`), behavioral pattern packs, and real-time interview signals that update in days, not months.
- **Sell side**: Submit anonymized "question -> answer -> offer/reject" trajectories to earn marketplace credits. Your identity is never shared — only aggregated, sanitized patterns.
- **Practice**: AI-powered mock interviews that use purchased question banks, complete with real-time feedback and progress tracking.

### Freshness

Glassdoor and LeetCode discussion boards are months stale. The AI Market protocol updates in **days**. Questions reported this week are available this week. When interview patterns shift — new hiring bars, new question formats, new behavioral themes — the marketplace reflects it immediately.

### Privacy: Your Answers Never Leave Your Device

Interview answers are processed **entirely on-device**. When you sell a trajectory, the PII is stripped before anything leaves your machine:

- Candidate name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL removed.
- Company name hashed to a one-way identifier.
- Location reduced to broad region (US-West, EU-Central, APAC-South).
- Interviewer names discarded.

Only the question text, anonymized answer summary, and outcome are submitted. See `lib/src/services/marketplace_service.dart` for the client-side PII stripping implementation.

## How It Uses the AI Market SDK

Interview Prep Coach is built on the `aimarket_agent` Dart SDK, which implements the AI Market Protocol v2 consumer cycle. Every marketplace interaction follows a 5-phase lifecycle:

### 1. Discovery: Find Interview Capabilities

```dart
import 'package:aimarket_agent/aimarket_agent.dart';

final agent = AimarketAgent(
  hubUrl: 'https://hub.aicom.io',
  walletKey: 'your-wallet-private-key-hex',
);

// Discover Google SWE behavioral question banks
final plan = await agent.discover(
  intent: 'Google SWE behavioral questions 2026',
  budget: 5.00,
  category: 'career',
);

// Discover real-time signals
final signals = await agent.discover(
  intent: 'recent interview questions asked at Google "what was asked this week" after:2026-05-01',
  budget: 2.00,
  category: 'career',
);
```

### 2. Open a Payment Channel

```dart
// Open a $5 channel — covers ~50 question bank calls at $0.10 each
final channel = await agent.openChannel(5.00);
```

### 3. Invoke: Purchase Interview Questions

```dart
final result = await agent.invoke(
  capabilityId: 'google-swe-q3-2026',  // from discovery
  input: {
    'target_role': 'Software Engineer',
    'years_experience': 4,
    'focus_areas': ['leadership', 'conflict_resolution'],
    'difficulty': 'medium',
  },
  channelId: channel.id,
  verifyTee: true,  // verify TEE attestation before sending
);

print('Questions: ${result.output}');
print('Cost: \$${result.priceUsd}');
print('TEE verified: ${result.teeVerified}');
```

### 4. Settle: Close Channel and Get Refund

```dart
final settlement = await agent.closeChannel(channel.id);
print('Spent: \$${settlement.totalSpentUsd}');
print('Refunded: \$${settlement.refundUsd}');
```

### 5. Verify: TEE Attestation

```dart
// Verify attestation before sending data
final verified = agent.verifyTeeAttestation(attestation, 'google-swe-q3-2026');

// Verify receipt after receiving output
final receiptVerified = agent.verifyTeeReceipt(receipt, sentInput, receivedOutput);
```

### Full Cycle with Bill of Materials

```dart
final bom = await agent.runOnce(
  intent: 'Google SWE behavioral questions 2026',
  input: {'target_role': 'Software Engineer', 'years_experience': 4},
  depositUsd: 5.00,
  category: 'career',
);

print('Total spent: \$${bom.totalSpentUsd}');
print('Settlement refund: \$${bom.settlement?.refundUsd}');
```
